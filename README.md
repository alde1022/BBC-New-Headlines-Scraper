# BBC Top News Headlines Scraper

This is a simple Python script that scrapes the top news headlines from the [BBC News](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news) website.

## Getting Started

To use this script, you will need:

1. Python 3.x installed.
2. The `requests` and `beautifulsoup4` libraries installed. These are Python libraries used for making HTTP requests and for parsing HTML, respectively. You can install them with pip:

   ```
   pip install requests beautifulsoup4
   ```

## Usage

To run the script, navigate to the directory containing the script in a terminal and then type:

```
python bbc_news_scraper.py
```

Replace `bbc_news_scraper.py` with the name of your script if it's different. When you run the script, it will print the top news headlines from the BBC News website to your terminal.

## Note

This script is for educational purposes only. It's a simple introduction to web scraping in Python. In a production environment, it would be better to use an API if one is available, as it would be more reliable and wouldn't depend on the website layout. 

This script could break if the BBC changes their website layout. Be mindful and respectful of the Terms of Service of the website, and don't use this script for scraping large amounts of data.
